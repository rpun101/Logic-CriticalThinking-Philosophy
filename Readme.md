+ `Proposition`
    - statement that can be either True or False
    - "Ducks are dirty."
    - Question cannot be proposition.
+ `Premise`
    - previous statement or proposition which inferred or follows as conclusion
    - [in words] so, because, since (be careful, may also be period of time)
+ `Conclusion`
    - The statement we conclude to, inferred from the premises.
    > All being are mortal.  P1   
    I am human being.  P2  
    Therefore, I am mortal.    = C  
+ [`Validity` Vs `Sound`](#validity-and-soundness)
+ [`Epistemology`](#epistemology)

+ `Counter Example`
    - one example that disapproves general statement.
    - "2 is counterexample to statement 'add prime number are odd`"

### Validity and Soundness ###
Validity is when conclusion follows the premise. It does not check weather the premise is true or false.
> Mary likes adventure sports.  
Sky diving is adventure.  
Hence, she likes cakes. ==> Where did cake came from!  

So this is not valid.  

Valid argument but with truthful premise is Sound. Argument can be valid but not sound.
> All African are black.  
Simba is African.  
So, he is black.   

Here, we need to find the truthfulness of the first premise. Most of the men being black, does not mean all African people are black. Above, argument is valid but fails the **Sound** test.

### Epistemology ###

how does one know the proposition is true? lets consider, Alex's argument. 
> USA is not a country.  
all country have flag.  
so, USA does not have a flag.  

The above statement, USA is not a country is false.(we know). then we can tell Alex's belief is false. So, to consider proposition as knowledge, we need to have true belief.  
**Not yet**  
lets say Sandy just flips a coin when asked if it is Monday? If it is head, she say YES and if it is tails, she says, NO. Suppose, today is Monday, you ask if today is Monday? she flips and gets head and she says yes. She maybe right is this case, but can we say she knows knows that today is Monday? So, we need to look at the **truth finding mechanism**. The process of finding in this case was not justifiable.  
As **Plato** says, to consider something as knowledge, it needs to be Justifiable True Belief(JTB)

+ `Epistemology` _a-pist-ta-ma-logy_ : theory of knowledge whether belief can be classified as knowledge.  



So, how do we find out the premise, 'all African are black' is false. How do we determine the premise is true.
to determine the proposition is true or false, it needs to have its own premises and conclusion. the premise's premise needs to be considered true. So, if we keep going through it, we will get stuck into the truth finding path. We can keep asking **"How do you know that?"** to every premise. We end up in the infinite loop. 
This is where the logic to of **Regress Argument** comes in. 


**Plato** example to end the regression.  
> To know a word is to know the letters of which the word is composed and their combination, but since letters are not composed of anything more basic, the way in which we know the letters can’t be the same as the way in which we know the word.  

However, if we put basic premise to other justification. Then how can one decide which premise needs another justification. If we are to apply same rule, then we have same infinite argument problem. If we apply another rule, then we have another problem of which is basic premise or where to stop. So, we have not solved the problem we have.  

> Plato's student, **Aristotle** (384-322 B.C.E) — tried to avoid this problem in his Posterior Analytics by grounding justification in propositions that do not need further justification because they contain their justification within themselves. These **'self-justifying'** propositions can thus be known to be true by 'intuition'. Axioms of mathematical proofs are the most obvious examples of self-evident or intuitively known propositions. They are the starting point for proofs, and not themselves the product of further proofs.  

Classic example: **I think, therefore, I am.**  So, how do we halt the problem of regress argument?

_Being lazy and just quoting from the course :)_

> They do this by identifying a class of foundational propositions that could be known to be true without further justification and which would serve as the basis upon which the rest of our knowledge could be built.
